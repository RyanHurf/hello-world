    <h1>The Relationship between Classical Music and Rock/Metal</h1>


  
    <section>
        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p class="indented">
            To understand the foundation of heavy metal, you must understand the foundation of classical music. Many melodic ideas within rock are rooted in classical music. Many pioneers of rock and metal grew up classically trained and interested in classical music theory and approach. Using knowledge of some of the greatest works composed, famous bands such as Deep Purple, Ozzy Osbourne, Rainbow, and more, have found ways to take these ideas, and put them behind distorted guitars and fast tempos. Classical music has helped metal evolve all around within its subgenres with the use of techniques and approaches.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Similar to the Romantic Era, metal music thrives off of emotion, individualism, and rebellion, thus evolving to the idea that rock and metal is aggressive and raw.

        <h2>Why use classial music in metal?</h2>
        <p class="indented">
            Listeners of classical music often use words triumphant, thrilling, and dramatic to describe classical music. Often depicting the powerful emotions and feelings one can get from listening to a symphony. These words used in describing these emotions are a common response from listeners who listen to aggressive, loud, and fast music like metal. Listeners of both genres often see the emotional impact of these pieces as if they were the same.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Metal music often thrives off of the raw sound and emotion given by the band mates and the lyrics following. Using the tools that composers use to create meaningful works is often carried over to metal. The skill level and ability to play these pieces can be impressive and captivating to someone who may have no background in music. The idea of playing these very technical passages with musicians wanting to push oneself.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Due to many of the pioneers studying/growing up with classical music, these artists have an understanding of creating music by looking at some of the greatest composers of all time. Playing classical music creates an understanding of harmony, voice leading, counterpoint, form, and more. With many of these artists pursuing music in a higher education in conservatories, they are given opportunities to analyze music with an understanding of what can add emotion to the music. Many of these parameters borrowed from classical music set the foundation of heavy metal.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Unlike classical music, many non instrumentalists listen to metal with no idea of understanding of the music before them. This often can create a gateway for metal music enjoyers to listen to classical music. There are many people who have found classical music through metal using the same descriptors to describe it. Reinforcing the emotion both genres create with or without lyrics.

        <h2>Parameters with Examples</h2>
        <h3>Melody</h3>
        <p class="indented">Melodies used for classical music and metal music are often comparable. With the approach being very similar by using the same scales and modes. Often creating a dark sound in metal music so many songs are commonly in harmonic minor, melodic minor, and phrygian. The use of trills and tremolo help make melodies in both genres. Many melodies are often played in sequences, playing the same melody again either modulated up or in a different context</p>

        <br />
        <h3>Harmony</h3>
        <p class="indented">Uses Functional harmony, including tonic, predominant, and dominant functions to create tension and release within the music. The use of modes are very popular within metal music too, especially phrygian dominant in more heavier cases of metal music.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <h3>Instruments and Orchestration</h3>
        <p class="indented">Throughout the many subgenres of rock and metal, the use of brass, woodwinds, strings, and choirs are commonly used. Generally used as a way to enforce and contribute to the melody while creating a huge mix in the background when listening to the songs. Often panning specific instruments in a way to make the song sound massive. Many rock songs take the form of classical music when creating larger works relating it to symphonies. Having multiple “movements” or “parts” in a single song with different melodies, motives, and feelings.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Rhythm and Meter</h3>
        <p class="indented">A huge part in metal music is often the physical aspect when going to concerts. Headbanging, mosh pits, and the wall of death. Many songs are throughout in a way to get the crowd moving to the song. So the use of rhythm and meter is stretched along all boundaries. Incorporating odd time signatures, ostinatos, polyrhythms and more. Thes use of techniques can make metal sound more aggressive and uncertain to the listener. An example for this one is Lateralus by Tool which incorporates the fibonacci sequence in its time signatures.</p>

        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Skill Level</h3>
        <p class="indented">For many works by classical composers often requires a high level of skill to be able to achieve the works. This heavily translates to metal. Often incorporating difficult techniques at a fast tempo which often require years of training. With many of these solos, which can be treated like candenzas, are often the moment for these instrumentalists to showcase their high level of skill to the audience which is often captivating. The example used is Through the Fire and Flames by DragonForce, this song is well known by many guitarists and is often noted as one of the hardest songs to play.</p>

        <h3>Theatrical Elements</h3>
        <p class="indented">Many artists make albums around a single idea or story, often telling it in a theatrical and dramatic way. Wanting the listener to be a part of this immersive story. Rhapsody of Fire is an Italian Symphonic Power Metal band who created a story that they have based multiple albums off of. Fantasizing a story about a fictional world where peace has come to an end with multiple nations and only the “Warrior of Ice” can stop the evil forces. There is even a Wiki created for the storyline. Another example is by Deathcore band Shadow of Intent with their release Reclaimer, telling the story of the Master Chief in the Halo series. Putting the story in an aggressive and immersive twist. </p>

        <h2>Nature of the quotes</h2>
        <p class="indented">
            The use of these quotes often contains direct use note for note or an imitation of the style. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. As used in Dee by Ozzy Osbourne, the guitarist, Randy Rhodes, was inspired by classical guitar techniques, specifically Andres Segovia’s interpretations of baroque pieces. This led to Randy Rhodes creating a 50 second classical guitar interlude on the album “Blizzard of Ozz”. These quotes often are used for narrative purposes by creating the setting of the album with gregorian chants to create a desired feeling. Or often reimagining a violin passage into a distorted guitar shredding.
